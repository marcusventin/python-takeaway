## Motivation
This project enables a user to simulate a takeaway restaurant and aims to satisfy the following user stories:

> As a customer,  
> So that I can check if I want to order something,  
> I would like to see a list of dishes with prices.  

> As a customer,  
> So that I can order the meal I want,  
> I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes.  

> As a customer,  
> So that I can verify that my order is correct,  
> I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order.  

> As a customer,  
> So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time,  
> I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered.
